This is just a minimal boilerplate visualization that has nothing but some placeholders, in the default plugin structure created by the Visualization Builder.

I prefer to create the structure first using some placeholders, using the visualisation builder. Once the plugin's been created and saved, that's the point where I leave the visualization builder and continue development with my favourite IDE.

The placeholders I've added (some console.log statements) help me find the code to start from.
